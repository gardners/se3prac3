Review of Pair Programming 
---------------------------

Background
-----------

Pair programming is a software development technique which involves two programmers working on the same code. Both programmers work together on one console, one taking the role of navigator and the other the role of driver.

The main function of the navigator is to direct the driver as to how the development of the code should proceed. 

While the navigator directs, the driver writes the actual code, concentrating on generating the software. The navigator can make suggestions while the code is being entered.

The pair should regularly swap roles after a predetermined period of time, or at specific small milestones in the development of the code.

Practical Task
---------------

Our class was given the taks of undertaking a pair programming exercise. We began with a practice session, in which we formed small groups and were provided with a list
of words. We were required to use each of the words in a short story, that we were to write, using the pair programming approach. 

While every group managed to create some form of story, I found that my group quickly went into "group" mode. It was more difficult than expected to stick to the pair programming schema. The practice task turned out to be good preparation for the practical, which was a coding task.

The practical task was to develop a date parser program that would be able to derive a date from a range of extremely different input, such as data in obvious date formats to seemingly data which was indistinguishable as dates. The first problem for us was to select a programming language. With differing programming skills we settled on Java as being the best compromise.

Results
--------

While we did not make huge progress on the task, the benefits of pair programming was definitely highlighted. While the driver coded the navigator made decisions to guide the team in finding the best result. However, we did not end up swaping roles as often as we should have because of the differences in our coding ability 

Conclusion
-----------
The impression I got from my experience of the practical task is that pair programming is a method of software development that requires some practice to execute effectively. I would have liked this method of software development to be introduced to me at an earlier stage in my degree, as I think it would have been beneficial, especially considering all the opportunities there have been for programming in groups of two. Overall I think it was valuable exercise and I enjoyed it.
