The purpose of this document is to provide a test plan for the 2048 game program. It will cover required resources needed to complete
testing, what tests are going to be performed and what test are not going to be performed.

The resources required to complete the testing process are as follows:
  -A unix machine
  -All the 2048Game program files
  -All the 2048Game test files

I will be making compliance tests, production tests and regression tests.

The compliance tests will test different stages of the program, as it is being developed. These include tests for functions such as
combining tiles, sliding tiles, rotating the board, etc.

The production tests will provide further testing for each stage of the program and will include further tests for each function listed
previously.

The regression tests will test for any regressions that might have occured from adding different functions to the program.

I will not be making commissioning tests or service and repair tests, as they are not necessary for this program.
