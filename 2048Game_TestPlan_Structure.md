1)
Design Verification or Compliance test - to be performed during the development or approval stages of the product, typically on a small
sample of units.

2)
Manufacturing or Production test - to be performed during preparation or assembly of the product in an ongoing manner for purposes of
performance verification and quality control.

3)
Acceptance or Commissioning test - to be performed at the time of delivery or installation of the product.

4)
Service and Repair test - to be performed as required over the service life of the product.

5)
Regression test - to be performed on an existing operational product, to verify that existing functionality didn't get broken when other
aspects of the environment are changed (e.g., upgrading the platform on which an existing application runs).






1)
Write an introduction. An introduction includes a general description and schedule of a test, as well as any related documents.
A document description provides an overall mission statement, covering the methods that will be used in the testing process and the
projected results. Related documents include any peripheral material that is relevant to the current project, such as lists of
specifications. A schedule details the increments of time in which each phase of the test will be completed.

The purpose of this document is to provide a test plan for the 2048 game program. It will cover required resources needed to complete
testing, what tests are going to be performed, what test are not going to be performed, an outline of risks and dependencies and testing
results.

2)
Write a section on required resources. This section describes all of the resources needed to complete the testing, including hardware,
software, testing tools, and staff.
When accounting for your staff, make sure to detail the responsibilities required of each member and the training needed to execute those responsibilities.

The resources required to complete the testing are as follows:
  -A unix machine
  -All 2048 Game program files
  -All 2048 Game test files

3)
Write a section on what you are going to test. List what new aspects you will be testing and what old aspects you will be re-testing.

I will be making compliance tests, production tests and regression tests.
The compliance tests will test different stages of the program, as it is being developed. These include tests for functions such as
combining tiles, sliding tiles, rotating the board, etc
The production tests will provide further testing for each stage of the program and will include further tests for each function listed
previously. 
The regression tests will test for any regressions that might have occured from adding different functions to the program.

4)
Write a section on what you will not be testing. List any features that will not be tested during the current project.

I will not be making commissioning tests or service and repair tests, as they are not necessary for this program.

5)
Write a section on risks and dependencies. Detail all the factors that your project depends on and the risks involved in each step.

6)
Write a section on the results of your project. Outline all the goals that you hope to achieve during the testing process. Detail the
parameters for which success and failure can be measured.
